<?php echo $rp_yearsago; ?> years ago, the student chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery at
the University of Illinois (ACM at UIUC) held its first annual student computing
conference. Attended by 150 students from across the Midwest and supported by
fourteen corporations, it was a great success.  MechMania (a C++/AI programming
contest) and a job fair have been great additions to the conference since the
beginning.

<p>

This year, the ACM at UIUC is holding its <?php echo $rp_number; ?> annual conference from <?php echo "$rp_days"; ?>,
<?php echo "$rp_year"; ?> at the Urbana-Champaign campus. We expect to have over 500
student attendees and 30 corporate sponsors. There will be over 20 sessions
(individual talks, panel discussions, and workshops) that will encompass the
past, present, and future of computing.

<p>

ACM could not host this conference without the generous support of our sponsors.
Corporate partners donate money, equipment, and prizes to the conference effort.
Because of their donations, student attendee fees can be kept low, and the
quality of all of our events is enhanced.
