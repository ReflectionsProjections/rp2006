Things to Note:
<ul>
    <li> There is only space for 16 teams in the student competition, so registration is on a first-come,
      first-serve basis. We do maintain a waiting list since some
      teams sometimes drop out or do not show up.
    </li>
    <li><b>All teams must be present for the kick-off and API review on Friday, 
      October 20th </b> (or have contacted us with a very good reason). 
      Absent teams will forfeit their space to teams on the waiting list. 
    </li>
    <li> To ensure a fair and balanced competition, and to maximize the 
	number of people able to participate, we require that all teams have 3 people. 
    </li>
    <li> <b>UIUC Teams:</b> Out of fairness to out-of-towners, the number of
      UIUC teams will be initially capped at 5; out-of-town teams will have priority over all
      other UIUC teams.
    </li>
    <li> For the student tournament, all 3 team members must be currently enrolled
      students.
    </li>                                               
    <li> The game administrators will make final determination on eligibility.
      Don't make us sic our mechs on you.
    </li>
</ul>
