<h1>Mechmania Documentation</h1>
<p>
Each team starts out with Pirate Boats, Rum Runners, and a pier. Your objective is to have the most software at then end of the game. Games last for 300 turns.<p>
Pirate Boats are the main type of boat. They can attack with cannons, board and take over ships, and steal software. To steal software you go to the enemy pier, load up as much as you can carry, and then take it back to your own pier.<p>
Rum Runners cannot attack or pick up software, but they can heal other boats that they are next to. A Rum Runner cannot heal itself and they cannot be boarded. They are faster than Pirate Boats.<p>
If you collide with an enemy boat you will take damage. The angle of the collision affects the damage done. You do not take damage if you collide with your own boats. <hr size="1"><address style="align: right;"><small>Generated on Sat Oct 21 11:53:07 2006 for Mechmania by&nbsp;
