In this talk I will share my life experience, motivations, dreams, successes
and failures.  It is my hope that those who attend will be inspired not only
to follow a career in computer science but to do so while thinking outside
the box and applying their skills to solving society's challenges. 

Computers are tools to be used to solve much more interesting and complex
problems in life.  Computer science is one of the greatest fields to choose
as a career because your skills can be applied to virtually any domain, from
education to genetic sequencing to space exploration to modern dance to
health care.  A successful career requires the understanding not only of
computer science techniques but also the domain to which they are applied. 
It is this application of computer science which, in my opinion, makes being
a computer scientist or engineer the greatest occupation the world has ever
known.
