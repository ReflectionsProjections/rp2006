On Why You Should Pay Any Attention to Him

When it comes to information technology, I know what I am talking about.
Thirty years in and around the PC business have earned me wisdom, if not
wealth. It's not that I am so smart, but that my friends are smart. The best
and brightest in Silicon Valley talk to me all the time. It's my job to sift
through their thoughts for valuable bits to share with you. But wait, if I
am so great, why is this service free? Good question! Maybe it's time to
renegotiate my contract with PBS.
