Stew

A stew is a collection of ingredients, prepared by simmering slowly.
My pocket dictionary also adds the definition "mental agitation."
The ingredients of this talk can come from any of the topics below,
or if anyone in the audience wants to add another ingredient to the
stew, he/she is welcome to do so.  We are computer scientists and
engineers, and we spend a lot of our energies creating technology.
My hope in this talk is to explore some of the issues we face, both
as computer people and as members of the human race.  Which ones we
spend time on depends on the audience.

Yale N. Patt

Yale Patt is a teacher at The University of Texas at Austin.  He is also the
Ernest Cockrell, Jr. Centennial Chair in Engineering, Professor of
Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Professor of Computer Sciences.  He
has done fundamental research in microarchitecture, producing (with his
students) the HPS paradigm, the Two-level Branch Predictor, Runahead
Execution, and Wish Branches, among other things.  More importantly, he gets
to teach the introductory freshman course in computing to 400 freshmen at UT
every other Fall.  He wrote the book for that course with Professor Sanjay
Patel of UIUC.  He also has an extensive consulting practice working with
microprocessor manufacturers on problems in microarchitecture and computer
systems.  He has received a number of awards for his research and teaching,
perhaps most notably the 1996 ACM/IEEE Eckert-Mauchly Award and the 2000 ACM
Karl V. Karlstrom Award.  He is a Fellow of both the IEEE and ACM.  More
