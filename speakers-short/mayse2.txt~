A Newton's-Method Formulation of the Reconnaissance-Satellite
Maneuver-Duration Problem

Reconnaissance satellites often have large, light weight, relatively
flexible structures; moreover, they have limited maneuvering energy.  They
are therefore subject to relatively modest dynamic limits--maximum angular
velocities, accelerations, and "jerks" (d<i>a</i>/d<i>t</i>).  The process
of maneuvering a satellite to point its sensors at a precise sequence of
targets cannot be modeled accurately without accounting for these limits.

The duration of such a maneuver is not readily computable in closed form,
because the vehicle's travel affects the necessary rotation.  Assuming a
planar rotation maneuver enables constructing an iterative algorithm to
resolve these coupled quantities.  Combining vector calculus and simple
physics in a Newton's-method formulation, this algorithm is implemented in
about 100 lines of C++, and can compute about 80,000 maneuver-times per
second on current PCs.  Millions of such computations are required when
analyzing and generating collection schedules.

The "slew model" described is embedded in IISYS (the Integrated Intelligence
Systems Simulator), used by SAIC to analyze system architectures, concepts
of operation, and their interrelations for the National Reconnaissance
Office.  Staffed by Air Force and CIA personnel, the NRO is the U.S.
Government's executive agency for space-based reconnaissance.  Science
Applications International Corporation is an employee-owned
professional-services firm of about 43,000 people, with annual sales
approaching $8 billion.

Chip Mayse

Dr. "Chip" (William C.) Mayse is in his second career, having previously
been an aerospace propulsion systems engineer.  Originally from Indiana and
educated (BSME, MSME) at Purdue, he served in the Air Force; studied systems
management (MS) at the University of Southern California; theology (MA) at
Fuller Seminary (Pasadena, CA); and was a thermal-analysis engineer at
Rocket Research Company (now Aerojet-Redmond) before switching to CS.  Since
leaving UIUC (Ph.D. '92), he has worked in Northern Virginia, mainly on
high-performance visualization and systems analysis software.  This includes
PowerScene: an early terrain scene-generator; a large, fast graph
data-mining system for the Dept. of Justice; the FIA Architecture and
Scheduler Testbed (FAST): a high-fidelity satellite-constellation simulator
for Boeing; and currently, IISYS and COSMOS.  For its contributions to
Operation Deliberate Force and the Dayton Peace Conference, PowerScene
received a Technology Laurels Award (1995) from Aviation Week Magazine.
